NMR is able to provide data on the water content and permeability of the soil, avoiding you to locate a drilling in a high water content but low permeable layer that would result in a low productivity. This instrument has been proven reliable in a large number of contexts (karsts, Vouillamoz et al., 2003; hard-rock aquifers, Legchenko et al., 2006, fractured aquifers, Wyns et al., 2004; coastal aquifers, Vouillamoz et al, 2007, water-filled cavities, Girard et al., 2005; glacier, Vincent et al., 2015, etc.). The Numis range equipment allows to realize NMR sounding up to 150m of depth.</p>
