        <p>During archeological studies, the determination of the location and of the spatial extension of the buried structures (e.g. walls of ancient and existing buildings, Himi et al., 2016) allows to determine precisely the area of investigation and the geometry of the buried structure (Selim et al., 2014, Terron et al., 2015). Electrical resistivity has been shown useful to image remains of buildings, tombs and other traces of ancient human activity.<br><br><br><br>The Syscal range is well adapted to image such structures at shallow depth (Syscal Kid Switch, Syscal Junior Switch). The following example shows the ability of the Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to image a tomb at shallow depth (0.5 - 1m) with a Syscal Kid Switch.<br></p>
