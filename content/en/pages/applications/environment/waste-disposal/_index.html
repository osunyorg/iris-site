        <p>Waste disposal are objects that need to remain under supervision during their whole lifetime. The first aspect of this supervision consists in checking the proper containment of wastes to avoid leachate’s leak through the geomembrane and through the possible clayey layers. The second aspect deals with the monitoring of the homogeneous re-circulation of leachate in the waste disposal to ensure an optimal biodegradation of waste.<br><br>The Syscal Switch range will allow to locate, determine the spatial extension and monitor the proper functioning of a waste disposal site (Syscal Junior Switch / Syscal R1 Switch / Syscal Pro Switch).<br><br>In the following example taken from Guérin et al. (2004), the leachate of a bioreactor is pumped and re-injected through a borehole. A monitoring of the electrical resistivity allows to image the recirculation of the leachate (expansion, velocity, diffusion). This type of measurement can be realized with a Syscal Pro Switch in monitoring mode to optimize the number and location of boreholes used for the reinjection of the leachate.<br></p>
