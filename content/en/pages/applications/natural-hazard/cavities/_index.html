    <p>  <br>Cavities generally occurring in calcareous soils (karst) or due to mining activity may constitute a real danger for all type of activity on the ground surface. The cavity may create ground surface subsidence to sinkhole, generating from fissure in the masonry to the total collapse of building. This phenomenon can also occur in dams. In all cases, the early detection of cavity is the only way to minimize risk for population and structures. Usually employed in complementarity to other methods, the electrical resistivity tomography may be sensitive to the presence of cavities.The Syscal Switch range is therefore well adapted to this type of applications (Syscal R1 Switch / Syscal Pro Switch).The Promis 10 slingram type EM profiler can also be adapted to image long linear or surface (such as for dams).</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Information request <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_ec8cd700575d4dd1985de557ab7f1e16/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_38a8c37d865f4c1fba55f7befa9085a7/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_fa9612bb78fe4539bec63064dea2cac9</p>
