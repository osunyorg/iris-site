        <p>Geotechnics can benefit greatly from geophysics. It can be used to identify different contrasted soil layers, to position drillings, to detect depth of foundations or to monitor soil remediation work such as resin infiltration.<br><br>The following example taken from Santarato et al. (2011) shows how electrical resistivity measurements has been use to monitor resins injection for the treatment and stabilization of foundation soils. Soil subsidence due to the local runoff of finer soil fractions can be treated by expanding resins injection. In this example, several injection points are located under the mansory that presents cracks and defects. The percentage difference between the resistivity measured before and after the injections shows a large increase of resistivity (higher than 25 %) where injections have been performed. This technique allows to ensure that the expanding resin penetrate correctly in the soil and that all the area is correctly treated.</p>

        <p>In all that cases, the Syscal and Syscal Switch ranges are well adapted to sound or image the soil electrical resistivity (Syscal Junior / Syscal Junior Switch / Syscal R1 / Syscal R1 Switch / Syscal R2 / Syscal Pro / Syscal Pro Switch).<br>The Promis 10 slingram type EM profiler can also be used to assess the lateral extension and depth of clayey layers for large areas.</p>
