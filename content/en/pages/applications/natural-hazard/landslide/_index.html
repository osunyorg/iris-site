        <p>Landslide is one of the major natural hazard in the world. Whether ancient and reactivated or recently triggered, the knowledge of the slip surface depth and geometry allow to estimate the landslide volume to analyze the risk for population and buildings. The Syscal and Syscal Switch range or Fullwaver are well adapted to such applications (Syscal Junior / Syscal Junior Switch / Syscal R1 / Syscal R1 Switch / Syscal R2 / Syscal Pro / Syscal Pro Switch).<br><br>In the following example, Travelletti and Malet (2012) have grid the Super-Sauze landslide with Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). They have been able to correlate dynamic penetration tests results with resistivity to dissociate different geotechnical layers and therefore to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the Super-Sauze landslide (depth of C1 and C2 geotechnical layers at each point of the landslide). This allowed to use a realistic geometry of the landslide in hydromechanical models and estimate more accurately the volume of the landslide for risk analysis.<br></p>

        <p>Recently, several research works have shown the possibility of monitoring landslide activity using ERT with the possibility of tracking deformations, infiltrations and soil water content variations with time (Gance et al., 2016, Travelletti et al., 2012, Wilkinson et al., 2010). <br><br>The Syscal Pro Switch with the monitoring option is well adapted for such monitoring applications of shallow to slightly deep landslides.<br>To investigate deeper landslides, we advise the use of the VIP range associated with the Elrec range. Finally, to map landslides over large areas, the Promis 10 slingram type EM profiler can help to highlight conductive anomalies over an area, linked to the presence of landslides.<br></p>
