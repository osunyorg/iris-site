        <p>For mining exploration applications, the method and equipment to use depend on how the precious metal is concentrated or disseminated in rocks, on the size of the orebody but also on its depth. The deep orebodies are generally difficult to image with geophysics and can require large 2D/3D tomography to estimate volumes. The VIP range of transmitters combined with the I &amp; V Fullwaver equipment are dedicated to this type of applications. The setup of several tens of static V Fullwavers (cableless) combined with the I Fullwaver that measure and store the current injected by the VIP transmitter at different location on the survey area, allow to measure, store, process and easily extract a 3D model of electrical resistivity and induced polarization.<br>Hereafter is presented a rapid example realized with 9 V-Fullwavers and one I-Fullwaver. 27 static measurement electrodes (blue points on the picture) have been setup on the area of investigation and 12 current injections (red points on the picture) randomly located have been performed using a pole-dipole array. 12 hectares have been covered on a mountaineous area (200 m max. of vertical drop). The automated post-processing allows to create a 3D image of the area in a record time (see 3D image of chargeability).</p>

        <p>A work in 2D or 3D is also possible using the Elrec Pro receiver associated with the switch Pro boxes and cables.</p>
