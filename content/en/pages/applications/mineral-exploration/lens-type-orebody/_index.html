        <p>For mining exploration applications, the method and equipment to use depend on how the precious metal is concentrated or disseminated in rocks, on the size of the orebody but also on its depth. Depending on its depth, lens type orebody can be detected by 2D or 3D tomography which is completed with TIPIX or VIP range transmitters associated with the Elrec range receivers.<br>For large and deep lens type orebody, the setup of several tens of static V Fullwavers (cableless) combined with the I Fullwaver that measure and store the current injected by the VIP transmitter, allow to measure, store, process and easily extract a 3D model of electrical resistivity and induced polarization.<br></p>
