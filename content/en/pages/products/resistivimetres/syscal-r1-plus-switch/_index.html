        <p>The SYSCAL R1 Plus resistivity meter is specifically designed for medium-depth exploration. It combines a power source, transmitter up to a 200W or 1200Vpp output voltage, and a 2 channels receiver in a single unit; its compactness makes it an effective tool for intensive resistivity surveys.<br><br>The different switching cards allow to work with 24 (Switch-24) up to 72 (Switch-72) electrodes. For imaging applications, Iris Instruments proposes different standard heavy-duty multi-core cables (5m or 10 m output separation. Other spacings on request). Customized cables may also be assembled for special arrays or non-standard applications.<br>Measurement sequences can be configured through the instrument interface or via the PC software Electre Pro (provided with the Syscal). Electre Pro enables operators to develop and interrogate 2D, 3D, downhole and roll long sequences prior to heading into the field, helping to minimize potential data collection errors. The measured data can be downloaded and processed before inversion via the PC software (Prosys II, provided with the Syscal).<br>The measurement is fully automatic, controlled by a microprocessor: automatic self-potential correction, automatic ranging, digital stacking for signal enhancement, error display in case of procedure troubles. The internal memory can store full information on intensity, voltage, resistivity, IP Chargeability, geometrical parameters and station number. A serial link permits transfer of the data to a microcomputer for plotting and interpretation of the data.<br><br>It can be used for civil engineering, groundwater and environmental projects, to solve problems such as depth-to-bedrock determination, localization of weathered bedrock, clay-gravel determination, measurement of depth and thickness of aquifers, salinity control, pollution monitoring, etc.<br><br>This versatile device is designed to work in a large number of configurations (SP measurements, sounding, profiling, 2D, roll-along, 3D and 4D monitoring surveys, etc.). The well-known reliability and accuracy of the Syscal range of resistivity meters will also mean extra value for both the contractor and the results end-user.</p>
