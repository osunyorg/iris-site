        <p>The Syscal R2 unit is a high-power system designed for DC electrical surveys applied to groundwater exploration, environmental studies, civil engineering, structural geology investigation and mineral exploration.<br><br>This system uses an external DC source for the injection:<br>- A 250W DCDC converter supplied by a 12V battery<br>- A 1200W AC/DC converter supplied by a standard motor generator.<br><br>The Syscal R2 combined with the 1200W converter is therefore particularly adapted to reach high depth for groundwater exploration. It can be used with an external Switch Pro box.<br></p>

        <p>It can be used for civil engineering, groundwater and environmental projects, to solve problems such as depth-to-bedrock determination, localization of weathered bedrock. Its power makes it adapted to detect fault in fractured bedrock aquifers and to explore groundwater aquifers (depth and thickness).<br></p>
