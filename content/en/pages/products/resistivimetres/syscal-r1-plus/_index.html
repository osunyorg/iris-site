        <p>The SYSCAL R1 Plus resistivity meter is specifically designed for medium-depth exploration. It combines a power source, transmitter up to a 200W or 800Vpp output voltage, and a 2 channels receiver in a single unit; its compactness makes it an effective tool for intensive resistivity surveys.<br><br>The measurement is fully automatic, controlled by a microprocessor: automatic self-potential correction, automatic ranging, digital stacking for signal enhancement, error display in case of procedure troubles. The internal memory can store full information on intensity, voltage, resistivity, IP Chargeability, geometrical parameters and station number. A serial link permits transfer of the data to a microcomputer for plotting and interpretation of the data.<br>It can be used for civil engineering, groundwater and environmental projects, to solve problems such as depth-to-bedrock determination, localization of weathered bedrock. Its power makes it adapted to detect fault in fractured bedrock aquifers and to explore groundwater aquifers (depth and thickness).<br></p>
