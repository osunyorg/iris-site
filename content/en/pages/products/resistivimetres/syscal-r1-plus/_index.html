    <p>2 ch, 1200Vpp, 200W</p><p>The SYSCAL R1 Plus resistivity meter is specifically designed for medium-depth exploration. It combines a power source, transmitter up to a 200W or 800Vpp output voltage, and a 2 channels receiver in a single unit; its compactness makes it an effective tool for intensive resistivity surveys.</p>
