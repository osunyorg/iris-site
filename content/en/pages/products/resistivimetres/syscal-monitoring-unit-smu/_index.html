    <p>  <br>The Syscal monitoring Unit is an automated system designed for the use of the Syscal Pro for monitoring survey.This unit connects the Rx and Tx batteries to the source of voltage of your choice (solar panel, wind turbine, isolated charger, ethanol fuel cell) when the Syscal is not acquiring. During the acquisition, the source of voltage is disconnected from the Tx and Rx batteries to avoid any leak of current that would perturbate the measurements.  This unit features two programmable systems :- An independent programmer that must be programmed on site- A automated system activated by the programmer that can be accessed and programmed remotely from a webpage (4G, Wifi, Ethernet)With the Syscal Monitoring Unit, change the time of acquisition, upload a sequence to the Syscal Pro from your office. Choose to receive alerts (low Tx battery, too much erroneous measurements, problem to download the data) on a custom email address. Program the automatic uploading of the acquired data on a FTP or SSH server or by email on a custom email address.Here is a schematic diagram of how can be used the Syscal Monitoring Unit :</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Request a sale quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_5e462409ae8c49ceb4507d2066298986/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_747245fc88c448d8af0f2a4a14c1e6d1/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_6be731c01866421cb8524b053dce4d00</p>  <p> Softwares  <br> Applications  <br>   <br>Water resources <br>Locate conductive fault in fractured acquifere <br>Assess water table characteristics <br>Characterize salt water wedge extension in groundwater <br>Environment <br>Monitor pollution <br>Detect leaks and monitor degradation in waste disposal <br>Locate and image buried structures <br>Natural hazard <br>Detect and characterize cavities <br>Assess landslide extension and volume <br>Detect and locate clayey layers for geotechnical application <br>Mineral exploration <br>Detect dike type orebody <br>Deep orebody or detection</p>  <p>Detect lens type orebody</p>  <p> Characteristics  <br> Documentation  <br>   <br>Datasheet</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Syscal_junior.pdf</p>  <p>Principles of geophysical methods for groundwater investigations</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Syscal_Monitoring_Unit_Gb.pdf</p>  <p> Tools  </p>
