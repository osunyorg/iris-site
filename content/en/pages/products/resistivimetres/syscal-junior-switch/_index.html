        <p>The Syscal Junior is an all-purpose resistivity imaging and sounding system for environmental applications. The system can be supplied as a standard imaging system capable of recording four measurements simultaneously. The four recording channels significantly improve data acquisition time when the instrument is fitted with internal switching board for 24 (Switch-24) 48 (Switch-48) or 72 (Switch-72) electrodes for Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT).<br><br>The output current is automatically adjusted (automatic ranging) to optimize the input voltage values and ensure the best measurement quality. The system is designed to automatically perform pre-defined sets of resistivity measurements with roll-along capability.<br>Compact, easy-to-use and field proof, the Syscal Jr Switch measures both resistivity and chargeability (IP). With a maximum power output of 100W at 800Vpp, the Syscal Junior is suitable for most near surface geophysical prospection applications, such as pollution monitoring, salinity control, depth-to-rock determination, weathered bedrock imaging and shallow groundwater exploration (depth and thickness of aquifers). In high resistance environment, it may be necessary to use the Syscal R1 plus.</p>
