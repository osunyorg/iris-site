        <p>Specifically designed for very shallow, high-resolution resistivity and induced polarization sounding and profiling, the Kid is the most compact of the Syscal range whilst retaining the well-known reliability and measurement accuracy of its counterparts.<br><br>Easy-to-use, automatic, field proof, with its 1 measurement channel, the Syscal Kid is ideal for archaeological, geological mapping and civil engineering and well logging applications. Its small weight (4.1 Kg) makes it particularly adapted for the manual acquisition of surface resistivity maps.<br><br>The Syscal Kid allows a direct reading of the resistivity and the chargeability (computed on 1 window). The device features 6 predefined and a user-defined arrays.<br></p>
