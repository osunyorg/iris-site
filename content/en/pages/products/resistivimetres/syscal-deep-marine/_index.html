        <p>In fresh water environment, the standard Syscal Pro can be used for marine resistivity profiling. However, in highly conductive environment, a modified variant with higher current output is required.<br><br>Thanks to its 10 reception channels, the Syscal Pro Deep Marine allows simultaneous collection of 10 resistivity data points corresponding to 10 depth levels.<br><br>The short current injection time allows recording of a set of 10 resistivities at about every 2 seconds; it makes this tool very efficient for this type of survey.<br></p>

        <p>A ruggedized streamer with 13 graphite takeouts can be supplied. Typical electrode spacings are 5, 10 and 15m. Depending on the depth of the water column, the streamer can either be floated near the water surface or submerged near the seabed.<br><br>GPS systems can be directly connected to the SYSCAL Pro Deep Marine unit thanks to a serial/USB data port; thus, the position of the electrodes for each measurement point will be known accurately. Specific GPS also offer an echo sounder transducer which can be directly connected to the PC; in that case, the software will integrate the resistivity data with the GPS coordinates and bathymetry.<br><br>The data, recorded by the SYSCAL Pro Deep Marine, are continuously transferred to a laptop by serial/USB communication. Simultaneously, the resistivity values are displayed in real time, numerically and graphically (2D section of resistivity).<br></p>
