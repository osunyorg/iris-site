    <p>  <br>The ProTester box can be used for the following tests: Pin to Pin continuity test: A measurement of resistance is done between the plugs connected into the front panel sockets of the ProTester box. This allows to be sure of the good continuity condition of the plugs of the Multi-conductor switch cables and of the sockets of the connecting boxes. Pin to Take-out continuity test: A measurement of resistance is done between the plugs connected into the front panel sockets and the corresponding take-out of the multi-conductor switch cable. This allows to be sure of the good continuity condition of the Multi-conductor switch cables. Electrical Isolation test: An injection is done in each pin (800V by default (the value can be modified depending on the specifications of your own cables) and a resistance measurement is done in other pins. This allows to be sure of the perfect electrical isolation of the Multi-conductor switch cables, of the Connecting boxes and of the Syscal Pro and Switch Pro units Relays test: A measurement of the resistance of each relay of the switching boards is done. This allows to be sure of the perfect operating of the internal switching relays board of the Syscal Pro and Switch Pro units. Self test: The ProTester box itself can be tested to check the electrical isolation and the output continuity of the front panel sockets.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Request a sale quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_5e462409ae8c49ceb4507d2066298986/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_38a8c37d865f4c1fba55f7befa9085a7/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_b7f7cad3612f475daecc83f12919abe4</p>  <p> Characteristics  <br> Documentation  <br>  </p>  <p>Datasheet</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Pro_tester.pdf</p>
