        <p>The MRS method is the only non-invasive method which directly <b>studies groundwater reservoirs from surface measurements</b>:<br>A pulse of current, at a given frequency is transmitted into a loop. The protons of the groundwater are excited. The signal produced during their return to equilibrium is measured with the same loop. To realize a sounding, different pulse moments (A.ms) are injected in the loop, all corresponding to different investigation depths.<br><br>This measure gives access to the soil water content (%) and is related to the mean pore size (permeability).<br></p>
