        <p>The <b>TIP 6000 is the new IP transmitter</b> developed by IRIS Instruments. It has been design has the successor of the VIP series. The design of the TIP 6000 has been driven by two key points : robustness and field efficiency.</p><p>Predominantly used as part of mineral exploration studies, the TIP 6000 is used together with V-Fullwavers or Elrec receivers.</p><p>The <b>f</b><b>ield efficiency is increased</b> with different options such as the automatic mode that computes automatically for the operator the optimal current to be injected. With this mode the injection of the optimal current can be done in two key presses without requiring increasing the current step by step.</p><p>An <b>intelligent current regulation</b> allows the operator to continue injecting even on very unstable resistance. If the TIP 6000 is unable to maintain the required current on highly variable contact resistance, it will automatically inject in voltage regulation mode for the user to finish the measurement without having to work on the contact resistance.</p>

        <p>This system can <b>regulate current</b> (ability to inject a stable current on a variable resistance with a variable input voltage) and can <b>regulate voltage</b> (ability to inject a stable voltage on a variable resistance with a variable input voltage) with an outstanding stability, allowing to reach unmatched accuracy on resistivity and IP measurements.<br>This stability makes this system the only high power transmitter in the world for measuring on-time IP. In this mode, the shape of the current injected doesn't contain off-time anymore (100% duty-cycle). The IP is directly measured during the injection resulting in acquisitions twice faster and an IP signal multiplied by two.</p><p>Hereunder is a comparison of 50% duty-cycle (standard acquisition mode) and 100% duty-cycle (on-time IP) showing the similarity between the two inverted sections.<br></p>

        <p>The TIP 6000 features also a <b>motor generator input power test</b> that automatically detects the optimal input power coming from the motor generator. At the first injection, the TIP 6000 takes some seconds to define this maximal power without any adjustment from the operator. This function allows the system to work automatically on a large range of motor generator and to preserve both systems from wear and tear with time.  <br><br>The TIP 6000 <b>features an automatic injection recorder</b> for a better quality control of the current entered in the receiver. The injection history can be visualized on the TIP 6000 screen or directly on a dedicated software after data download.<br><br>The <b>operator's security and the system protection</b> against breakdown are ensured by numerous standard function like automatic self-tests, emergency stop, short circuits, open-line, overcurrent, thermal protection, input overvoltage and under-voltage. In addition to the overheat protection, the TIP 6000 features an automatic gradual adaptation of the power after 32 stacks to not overpass maximal temperature, allowing to inject for hours.<br><br>Contact use to know more about the numerous other options available soon on TIP 6000 (like master-slave mode, GPS synchronization, creation and upload of your own waveform) and  other new features being improved by our R&amp;D departement. <br></p>
