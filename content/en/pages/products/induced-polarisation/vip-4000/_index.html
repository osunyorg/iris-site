    <p>  <br>The  VIP series of Electrical transmitters  are purposely designed for deep induced polarisation or Resistivity sounding investigations. The Vip injects a  regulated current   into the ground. Predominantly used as part of mineral exploration studies, the VIP series include three systems with different power specifications. This transmitter is generally used together with V-Fullwavers or Elrec Pro receivers. To simplify operation,  the instrument manages the injection current and voltage automatically . When starting, the VIP automatically operates several safe tests to ensure that the device is not misused.</p>  <p>   <br>All VIP systems offer four operating modes:  <br> Time domain waveform, On Time (Ton) and Off time (Toff),  <br> Frequency domain waveform, outputting two user-selectable frequencies from 0.0625Hz and 4Hz.  <br> Dual frequency mode, a base frequency is selected from 0.0625 to 0.5Hz and the high frequency is fixed at 8 times the base frequency.  <br> Continuous mode, injects a constant DC current into the ground.  <br> The VIP 4000 power makes it suitable for use in almost all geological formations. In situation where a wired synchronization is not possible, the VIP can be operated alongside the I-Fullwaver for accurate absolute time stamps when recording precise full waveform time domain measurements.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Request a sale quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_1e0bfe46ea9c4625bc17ab4b19f3c906/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_cf5bad6947474bf3b6dec3c43cff6bb0/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_f8c4b808630b4147aa89a9b14add589d</p>  <p>Compare transmitter <br>/en/products/induced-polarisation/#transmitter</p>  <p> Softwares  <br> Applications  <br>   <br>Water ressources  <br> Locate conductive fault in fractured acquifere  <br> Assess water table characteristics  <br> Characterize salt water wedge extension in groundwater  <br> Environment  <br> Monitor pollution  <br> Detect leaks and monitor degradation in waste disposal  <br> Locate and image buried structures  <br> Natural hazard  <br> Detect and characterize cavities  <br> Assess landslide extension and volume  <br> Detect and locate clayey layers for geotechnical application  <br> Mineral exploration  <br> Detect dike type orebody  <br> Deep orebody or detection  <br> Detect lens type orebody  <br>  <br> </p>  <p> Characteristics  <br> Documentation  <br>   <br>Datasheet</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Vip_4000.pdf</p>  <p>General safety instructions</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/General_safety_instructions_Gb.pdf</p>  <p>Checklist</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/checklist_VIP.pdf</p>  <p>Accessories</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Accessories_RhoIP.pdf</p>  <p>Principles of geophysical methods for groundwater investigations</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Groundwater_text.pdf</p>  <p> Tools  </p>
