    <p>  <br>The  V-FullWaver  systems were specifically developed for  precise full waveform time domain  Induced Polarisation, Resistivity and SP measurements. Each system is fully independent; incorporating its own power source,  GPS module and digital memory for up to 3 months continuous recording . The V-FullWaver is a dual channel Induced Polarisation, Resistivity and SP receiver. Continually recording at 10ms sample rate provides a full waveform record. It can be  synchronized on the GPS PPS signal , allowing an easy process of the signal. Data on the memory can be downloaded directly on a simple USB stick from all the Fullwavers.</p>  <p>   <br>The timeseries recorded by the I&V FullWavers can be post-processed on the dedicated software FullWave Viewer that allows to adapt the processing according to the signal/noise ratio, to focus on stable and accurate parts of the signal, to remove SP spikes and to resynchronize the data if necessary. This software allows also for a rapid automatic process of the data and thus for exporting resistivity and chargeability data to compute a first 3D model in few minutes.</p>  <p>   <br>The FullWaver devices have been designed for the  measurement of resistivity, IP and PS on large 3D surfaces  which can be affected by sharp topography. Depending on the size of the area to investigate, 10 or more V-FullWaver devices can be randomly located on the surface of investigation performing a continuous measurement. In the meantime, the operator moves a transmitter (typically VIP) and the I-FullWaver on the same surface to perform different injection. At the end of the day, the data has to be copied on a USB key from each FullWaver. If the electrode coordinates have been entered in the devices, a first automatic process can export the resistivity and IP data in Prosys II. You can therefore obtain a first 3D model in few minutes while keeping the possibility to re-process the entire dataset. The following video summarizes the operating procedure of the use of the V-FullWaver with any IP transmitter and resumes the main advantages of this sytem compared to non-autonomous systems.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S_sI8hcDs0 <br>Operating procedure of I and V-Fullwaver <br>Operating procedure of I and V-Fullwaver <br>  </p>  <p>Request a sale quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_5e462409ae8c49ceb4507d2066298986/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_b7b8089ae792471c80846f93f65ebce5/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_85f163f18e224d2bb4d291437e58532f</p>  <p>Request a rental quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_1e0bfe46ea9c4625bc17ab4b19f3c906/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_b7b8089ae792471c80846f93f65ebce5/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_85f163f18e224d2bb4d291437e58532f</p>  <p>Compare receiver <br>/en/products/induced-polarisation/#receiver</p>  <p> Softwares  <br> Applications  <br>   <br>Water ressources  <br> Locate conductive fault in fractured acquifere  <br> Assess water table characteristics  <br> Characterize salt water wedge extension in groundwater  <br> Environment  <br> Monitor pollution  <br> Detect leaks and monitor degradation in waste disposal  <br> Locate and image buried structures  <br> Natural hazard  <br> Detect and characterize cavities  <br> Assess landslide extension and volume  <br> Detect and locate clayey layers for geotechnical application  <br> Mineral exploration  <br> Detect dike type orebody  <br> Deep orebody or detection  <br> Detect lens type orebody  <br>  <br> </p>  <p> Characteristics  <br> Documentation  <br>   <br>FullWaver brochure</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/FullWaver_Gb.pdf</p>  <p>Datasheet</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/V_fullwaver.pdf</p>  <p>Transmitter notebook example</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/FullWaver_Tx_Notebook.xlsx</p>  <p>Advised operating procedure</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/advised_operating_procedure_Gb.pdf</p>  <p>Checklist</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/checklist_Fullwavers.pdf</p>  <p>Principles of geophysical methods for groundwater investigations</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Groundwater_text.pdf</p>  <p> Tools  </p>
