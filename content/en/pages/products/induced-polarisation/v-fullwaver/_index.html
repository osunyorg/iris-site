        <p>The <b>V-FullWaver</b> systems were specifically developed for <b>precise full waveform time domain</b> Induced Polarisation, Resistivity and SP measurements. Each system is fully independent; incorporating its own power source, <b>GPS module and digital memory for up to 3 months continuous recording</b>.<br><br>The V-FullWaver is a dual channel Induced Polarisation, Resistivity and SP receiver. Continually recording at 10ms sample rate provides a full waveform record. It can be <b>synchronized on the GPS PPS signal</b>, allowing an easy process of the signal. Data on the memory can be downloaded directly on a simple USB stick from all the Fullwavers.<br></p>

        <p>The timeseries recorded by the I&amp;V FullWavers can be post-processed on the dedicated software FullWave Viewer that allows to adapt the processing according to the signal/noise ratio, to focus on stable and accurate parts of the signal, to remove SP spikes and to resynchronize the data if necessary. This software allows also for a rapid automatic process of the data and thus for exporting resistivity and chargeability data to compute a first 3D model in few minutes.<br></p>

        <p>The FullWaver devices have been designed for the <b>measurement of resistivity, IP and PS on large 3D surfaces</b> which can be affected by sharp topography. Depending on the size of the area to investigate, 10 or more V-FullWaver devices can be randomly located on the surface of investigation performing a continuous measurement. In the meantime, the operator moves a transmitter (typically VIP) and the I-FullWaver on the same surface to perform different injection. At the end of the day, the data has to be copied on a USB key from each FullWaver. If the electrode coordinates have been entered in the devices, a first automatic process can export the resistivity and IP data in Prosys II. You can therefore obtain a first 3D model in few minutes while keeping the possibility to re-process the entire dataset.<br><br><br>The following video summarizes the operating procedure of the use of the V-FullWaver with any IP transmitter and resumes the main advantages of this sytem compared to non-autonomous systems.<br></p>
