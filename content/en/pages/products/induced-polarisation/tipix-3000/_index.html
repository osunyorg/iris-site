        <p>The TIPIX 3000 is a transmitter purposely designed for deep Induced Polarisation or Resistivity sounding investigations. This transmitter is generally used together with V-Fullwavers or Elrec Pro receivers.</p><p>This entry-level instrument has been designed for an ease of use and for a good productivity together with a strong protection against misuse. This very robust device has proven to be reliable even in very cold weather or in wet environment. It is able to inject up to 3000W in the soil and to inject up to 13A, so that it is suitable, even on conductive soils, to measure resistivity and IP at medium range depths. It is powered by standard generator.</p><p>With the possibility to limit current, power, voltage, and the different self-test and quality control of the injected signal, the TIPIX ensure a good protection for the device and he operator. This instruments features 4 buttons on the front face that allow the operator to select manually different voltage injection levels. The “automatic range” mode allow to select automatically the optimal injection level regarding the contact resistance.</p>

        <p>The MASTER-SLAVE mode allows to connect two TIPIX in series, whatever their power. This type of connection adds the maximum voltage and power of the two systems to increase the amount of current injected on medium to high contact resistance values. </p><p>Using two TIPIX 3000 connected in series increases maximum power to 6000W and maximum voltage to 5000V (or 10000Vpp).</p><p>The use of the MASTER-SLAVE mode is very easy as it is automatically recognized and the combined system maximum voltage and power is automatically updated. The two TIPIX can be powered by a single motor generator making the complete system light and portable.</p><p>To increase your productivity, several TIPIX can be synchronized together via external GPS. The Toff time used for IP measurements is therefore synchronized, so that one can perform several IP measurements on nearby places without interfering from one measurement on the other.<br>This option can be used also to increase the signal/noise ratio by injecting with several synchronized TIPIX.<br></p>
