    <p>  <br>The Elrec 6 is a 6-channel Induced Polarisation (IP) and Resistivity receiver designed to improve productivity when recording deep profiles and soundings. Beside the classical arithmetic and logarithmic modes, ELREC 6 also offers a Cole-Cole mode and ten fully programmable windows for a higher flexibility in the definition of the IP decay curve.A setup wizard guides the operator through each parameter to ensure the instrument is configured correctly.The system includes built-in quality control tools to aid the operator validate measurements during data acquisition, and displays IP decay curves in real time.</p>  <p>   <br>The Elrec 6 is designed for use with the TIPIX and VIP high power transmitters’ series. The Elrec automatically synchronizes (and re-synchronizes at each new pulse) with the transmission signal, through the waveform recognition process, ensuring high measurement repeatability.For large 2D and 3D surveys, the Elrec 6 can be used in conjunction with the Switch Pro box(es), increasing the spread to 96 electrodes. When operating the system in this manner, complex measurement sequences can be designed and uploaded to the system via Electre II or Electre Pro software.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Request a rental quote <br>https://irisinstruments.budibase.app/embed/call-back-form/#/en/ro_ta_a2d2d4c76c5a4d499600a0729133da20_1e0bfe46ea9c4625bc17ab4b19f3c906/ro_ta_51b4f1d6e17d4f4b92e5260d841cb301_b7b8089ae792471c80846f93f65ebce5/ro_ta_18ccdce74d4a4c4f8d9905d88657c886_58938233407a41ceb69217dfbc8bb023</p>  <p>Compare receiver <br>/en/products/induced-polarisation/#receiver</p>  <p> Softwares  <br> Applications  <br>   <br>Water ressources <br>Locate conductive fault in fractured acquifere <br>Assess water table characteristics <br>Characterize salt water wedge extension in groundwater <br>Environment <br>Monitor pollution <br>Detect leaks and monitor degradation in waste disposal <br>Locate and image buried structures <br>Natural hazard <br>Detect and characterize cavities <br>Assess landslide extension and volume <br>Detect and locate clayey layers for geotechnical application <br>Mineral exploration <br>Detect dike type orebody <br>Deep orebody or detection <br>Detect lens type orebody</p>  <p> Characteristics  <br> Documentation  <br>   <br>Datasheet</p>  <p>Checklist</p>  <p>Master curves for schlumberger sounding interpretation</p>  <p>Principles of geophysical methods for groundwater investigations</p>  <p> Tools  </p>
