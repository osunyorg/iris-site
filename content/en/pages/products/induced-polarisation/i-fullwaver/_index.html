        <p>The <b>I-FullWaver</b> systems were specifically developed for <b>precise full waveform</b> time domain induced polarisation, Resistivity and self-potential measurements. Each system is <b>fully independent</b>; incorporating its own power source, <b>GPS module and digital memory for up to 3 months continuous recording</b>.<br><br>The I-FullWaver sits in series between the injection electrode and transmitter (e.g. TIPIX, VIP) recording the AB injection current to within 3mA. Sampling at up to 100Hz, the <b>GPS PPS is used to synchronise</b> an internal clock in order to accurately time stamps each record within an absolute accuracy of 250us. The I-FullWaver can be used alongside the V-FullWaver or Elrec Induced polarisation receivers.</p>

        <p>The timeseries recorded by the I&V FullWavers can be post-processed on the dedicated software Fullwaveviewer that allow to adapt the processing according to the signal/noise ratio, to focus on stable and accurate parts of the signal, to remove SP spikes and to resynchronize the data if necessary. This software allows also a rapid automatic process of the data and thus export resistivity and chargeability data to compute a first 3D model in few minutes.</p>

        <p>The Fullwaver devices have been designed for the<b> </b><b>measurement of resistivity, IP and PS on large 3D surfaces </b>which can be affected by sharp topography. Depending on the size of the area to investigate, 10 or more V-FullWaver devices can be randomly located on the surface of investigation, performing a continuous measurement. In the meantime, the operator moves a transmitter (typically VIP) and the I-FullWaver on the same surface to perform different injection. At the end of the day, the data has to be copied on a USB key from each FullWaver. If the electrode coordinates have been entered in the devices, a first automatic process can export the resistivity and IP data in Prosys II. You can therefore obtain a first 3D model in few minutes while keeping the possibility to re-process the entire dataset.</p>
