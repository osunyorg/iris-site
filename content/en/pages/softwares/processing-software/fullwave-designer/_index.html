    <p>  <br>FullWave Designer software is a PC software allowing to design your own survey with Fullwaver systems. Place rapidly your systems on a georeferenced map, locate your V-FullWaver electrodes and injection places. Check that the maximal investigation depth corresponds to the one of the target. Create rapidly images and schemes for your reports and export a datasheet containing all electrodes location for a quick and accurate setup by low qualified staff.  <br> Allow to design your survey on a grid  <br> Visualize electrode location on google Earth  <br> Check that the location is accessible  <br> Visualize report points  <br> Compute report points, depths of investigation and geometric factors  <br> Check that you reach your target  <br> Generate a datasheet with the electrode coordinates  <br> </p>  <p> Download </p>  <p>FullWave Designer <br>Download <br>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Download/FullWaveDesigner/SetupFullWaveDesigner.exe</p>  <p>PDF</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Fullwavedesigner_Gb.pdf</p>
