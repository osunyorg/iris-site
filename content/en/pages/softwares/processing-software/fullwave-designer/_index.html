        <p>FullWave Designer software is a PC software allowing to design your own survey with Fullwaver systems.<br>Place rapidly your systems on a georeferenced map, locate your V-FullWaver electrodes and injection places. Check that the maximal investigation depth corresponds to the one of the target. Create rapidly images and schemes for your reports and export a datasheet containing all electrodes location for a quick and accurate setup by low qualified staff.<br></p><ul> <li>Allow to design your survey on a grid</li> <li>Visualize electrode location on google Earth</li> <li>Check that the location is accessible</li> <li>Visualize report points</li> <li>Compute report points, depths of investigation and geometric factors</li> <li>Check that you reach your target</li> <li>Generate a datasheet with the electrode coordinates<br> </li> </ul>
