        <p>The ELECTRE Pro software is a program allowing to create some 2D-3D-surface/boreholes sequences of measurement for IRIS Instruments SYSCAL Pro-Switch resistivity-meters.</p><p><br>The ELECTRE Pro software allows to create automatically (accounting an estimated maximum investigation depth, user specified) or manually, some sequences of measurements with many possibilities:</p><ul> <li>Use of any type of standard electrode arrays (dipole-dipole, reciprocal Schlumberger-Wenner, poledipole forward &amp; reverse, cross diagonal pole-pole …)</li> <li>Definition of the levels of investigation with the possibility of multi-spacing configuration for data quality improvement</li> <li>Optimization of sequences for higher acquisition speed (the optimization process can add some measurements (gapfiller quadripoles) that can be rejected after acquisition (by the PROSYS II IRIS Instruments software)).</li> </ul><p>The ELECTRE Pro software allows also to import any type of sequences, manually created in ″txt″ file, in case of specific applications<br> </p><ul> </ul>
