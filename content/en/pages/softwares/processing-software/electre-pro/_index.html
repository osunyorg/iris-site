    <p>  <br>The ELECTRE Pro software is a program allowing to create some 2D-3D-surface/boreholes sequences of measurement for IRIS Instruments SYSCAL Pro-Switch resistivity-meters. The ELECTRE Pro software allows to create automatically (accounting an estimated maximum investigation depth, user specified) or manually, some sequences of measurements with many possibilities:  <br> Use of any type of standard electrode arrays (dipole-dipole, reciprocal Schlumberger-Wenner, poledipole forward & reverse, cross diagonal pole-pole …)  <br> Definition of the levels of investigation with the possibility of multi-spacing configuration for data quality improvement  <br> Optimization of sequences for higher acquisition speed (the optimization process can add some measurements (gapfiller quadripoles) that can be rejected after acquisition (by the PROSYS II IRIS Instruments software)).  <br> The ELECTRE Pro software allows also to import any type of sequences, manually created in ″txt″ file, in case of specific applications  <br> </p>  <p> Download  <br>Electre Pro <br>Download <br>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Download/ElectrePro/setupElectrepro.exe</p>  <p>PDF</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/ElectrePro_Gb.pdf</p>
