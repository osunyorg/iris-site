    <p>  <br>The COMSYS Pro software is a program allowing to control a SYSCAL Pro-Switch resistivity-meter in multi-electrode mode, from a PC. This software is especially dedicated for monitoring applications as a running step can be defined to run some sequences in an automatic way and the data are continuously transferred into the computer (so, no memory limitation). The main functions of the COMSYS Pro software are the following ones:  <br> Use any type of sequence (2D – 3D – surface/borehole)  <br> Modes available:  <br>          - Standard measurement          - SP (Spontaneous Polarization) measurement          - High speed (150 ms injection time) measurement  <br>  Measurement and storage of the grounding resistance values  <br> Real time data (resistivity - chargeability, …) visualization  <br> Continuously data storage during acquisition into the computer  <br> Display of the estimated time remaining of the current sequence  <br> Graphical visualization of the current measuring quadripole  <br> Creation of a script for automatic sequence running (resistivity monitoring)  <br> </p>  <p> Download </p>  <p>Comsys pro <br>Download <br>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Download/ComsysPro/SetupComsysPro.exe</p>  <p>PDF</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/ComsysPro_Gb.pdf</p>
