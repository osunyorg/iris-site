        <p>The SYSMAR software is an acquisition and picturing program designed to manage resistivity surveys in continuous mode, such as in marine applications.<br>The resistivity-meter devoted to perform such survey is the SYSCAL Pro unit.<br>Thanks to its 10 reception channels, the SYSCAL Pro allows to obtain simultaneously 10 resistivity data points corresponding to 10 depth levels.<br>The short current injection time (150 ms) allows to record a set of 10 resistivities very quickly ; in case of a GPS/Sounder recording during the profile, the acquisition step is about 2 s.</p>
