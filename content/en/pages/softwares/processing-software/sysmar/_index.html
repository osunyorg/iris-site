    <p>Remote control Acquisition for continuous marine or land  survey</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The SYSMAR software is an acquisition and picturing program designed to manage resistivity surveys in continuous mode, such as in marine applications. The resistivity-meter devoted to perform such survey is the SYSCAL Pro unit. Thanks to its 10 reception channels, the SYSCAL Pro allows to obtain simultaneously 10 resistivity data points corresponding to 10 depth levels. The short current injection time (150 ms) allows to record a set of 10 resistivities very quickly ; in case of a GPS/Sounder recording during the profile, the acquisition step is about 2 s.</p>  <p> Download </p>  <p>Sysmar <br>Download <br>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Download/Sysmar/setupSysmar.exe</p>  <p>PDF</p>  <p>https://download.iris-instruments.com/Documents/Sysmar.pdf</p>
