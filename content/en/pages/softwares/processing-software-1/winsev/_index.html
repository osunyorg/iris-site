        <p>This software is designed for Schlumberger, Wenner and pole-pole spreads. The possibility of displaying several surveys simultaneously facilitates the comparison between close surveys. The displayed curves, as well as the electric model of the active survey, with altitudes of the grounds and its raw data, are printed on any printer supported by Windows® and can also be transferred as metafiles. Version 6 makes it possible to carry out electric profiles of surveys.<br></p>
