        <p>This Battery tester has been designed to estimate the autonomy of a battery for different loads.<br><br>The role of the batteries is essential for all electrical prospecting surveys with a resistivity-meter and particularly in multi-electrode mode as it is sometimes necessary to inject huge amounts of current during several hours, by using continually external batteries. That is the reason it is important to control regularly the state of the batteries and to be sure to go on the field with good capacity batteries. Indeed, even if a battery has a good voltage value out of injection, this level can weaken during the current transmission in case of an old battery.<br><br>The tests are realized on 50W, 100W and 250W power charge.<br></p>
